# github-training
Test project for Github training. This is my first (technically second) repository.

## About
This is a description of the project. This one has no point, so therefore there is none.

## Team
It's just a team of me and my imaginary friends, Tim, Tom and Ted.

## Setup & Requirements
This project needs an open mind and a willingness to explore.
